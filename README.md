## Dorm Manager

Our project for CPSC 304 (Relational Databases). The aim of this project was to use OracleDB to represent the current state of a university residence. Our database stores information about the state of each dorm, as well as who is currently living in each room. Our database also keeps track of resident activity by storing maintenance requests, sublets and package deliveries. On the frontend, users can fetch, add, update and delete data - pretty much what you'd expect from any real relational database management system.
